### My introduction

***Hello, my name is Sierra Schlief.*** I'm in the final year of my _Bachelor of Environmental Science (Hons.) degree._ My honors thesis is based on using the microchemistry of **otoliths** from fish to understand the anthropogenic pollution in the Red River. 
I am a beginner to R and am excited to learn more. 
I am using Windows. 
I am in the market for a monitor as I only have a laptop.
