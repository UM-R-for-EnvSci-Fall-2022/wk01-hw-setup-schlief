# Week 01 Homework - GitHub set-up and initial introductionSetup
Edit this `README.md` file right here in GitHub to include:

- A brief introduction about yourself (e.g. your major/program, what are your main topics of interest or what is your thesis about if youa re a grad student)
- Do you have any experience whith R? if so how much? What have you done?
- What OS are you using (Windows/Mac/Linux?)
- Will you be using two screens for this course (not needed, but if everybody is, i will re-arrrange my windows in a diferent way)

PS: Feel free to delete my text and use as much Markdown formating as you want (lots of help [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
